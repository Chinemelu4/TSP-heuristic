# TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) Solver

This command-line tool is designed to determine the shortest distance to visit all cities in a given list. The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the most efficient route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository or download the script directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chinemelu4/TSP-heuristic.git
cd TSP-heuristic
```

## Usage

### 1. Cities Command

Run the following command to calculate the shortest distance for a given list of cities:

```bash
./tsp_solver.py cities "City1" "City2" --count 5
```

- Replace `"City1"`, `"City2"`, etc., with the names of the cities you want to include in the optimization.
- The `--count` option allows you to specify the number of simulations to run. The default is 5.

### 2. Simulate Command

Run the following command to simulate the TSP solution multiple times and print the shortest distance along with the cities visited:

```bash
./tsp_solver.py simulate --count 10
```

- The `--count` option allows you to specify the number of times to run the simulation. The default is 10.

## Example

### Cities Command Example

```bash
./tsp_solver.py cities "New York" "Knoxville" "Birmingham" --count 3
```

Output:

```
Running simulation 3 times
Running simulation: 0: Found total distance: 1742.95
Running simulation: 1: Found total distance: 1742.95
Running simulation: 2: Found total distance: 1725.82
Shortest Distance: 1725.82
Cities Visited: ['Los Angeles', 'Birmingham', 'Phoenix', 'Boston', 'Fort Worth', 'Raleigh', 'Cleveland', 'San Diego', 'Baltimore', 'Houston', 'New York', 'Knoxville', 'Dallas', 'Atlanta', 'Seattle', 'Denver', 'Chicago', 'Miami', 'San Francisco', 'Bangor']
```

### Simulate Command Example

```bash
./tsp_solver.py simulate --count 5
```

Output:

```
Running simulation 5 times
Running simulation: 0: Found total distance: 1732.33
Running simulation: 1: Found total distance: 1750.51
Running simulation: 2: Found total distance: 1705.97
Running simulation: 3: Found total distance: 1723.66
Running simulation: 4: Found total distance: 1719.06
Shortest Distance: 1705.97
Cities Visited: ['Birmingham', 'Denver', 'New York', 'Houston', 'San Francisco', 'Miami', 'Raleigh', 'Fort Worth', 'Dallas', 'Chicago', 'Boston', 'Bangor', 'Los Angeles', 'Cleveland', 'Phoenix', 'San Diego', 'Knoxville', 'Baltimore', 'Atlanta', 'Seattle']
```

Feel free to experiment with different cities and simulation counts to observe the optimized routes generated by the TSP solver.
